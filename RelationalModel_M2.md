## Relational Data Model and Project Schema for Milestone 2

# Entities and Description

1. Food banks: The food bank relation has an internal ID (denoted as FB_ID) which acts as the primary key for the relation. foodBankUsername is a unique username chosen by the food bank that they use to log in to the dashboard. This relation is connected to the Donation relation and Documentation relation, both of which have FB_ID as one of the attributes. 

2. Donor: A donor is an individual, a corporation, a community garden, a school, or a church that makes a donation to the food bank. The donor relation has an internal ID (denoted as DN_ID) which acts as the primary key for the relation. donorUsername is a unique username chosen by the donor that they use to log in to the dashboard. This relation is connected to the Donation relation which has DN_ID as one of its attributes. This foreign relation helps track the donor who made the donation. 

3. Donation: Donation is what was donated by an organization to a food bank. Donation relation also has an internal ID that tracks donations from a particular distributor or donor to a particular food bank. Donation relation requires internal IDs of both the donor and the food bank (foreign keys used as a composite key). It is created whenever a donor/distributor makes a donation. Its attributes are the Type of Donation (food, toys, etc.), Quantity of Donation (lbs or number), and Expiration Date.

4. Documentation: Documentation is a particular registration or food certification document of a food bank or a donor  Documentation relation that uses the official registration or certificate number as its primary key. It has the internal IDs of Foodbank and Donor as foreign keys to track which organization a particular document belongs to.

5. Message: Message refers to the messages between donors and food banks to facilitate the donation. The content, sender, receiver, and time stamps of the messages are stored for documentation purposes.

# Reflection

The decisions we made while creating the ERD were deciding which entities will be represented in the diagram and how they will be related to each other. We referred to the ERD diagram to make sure that the entities, and attributes, are consistent. Although we felt confident in our decisions, we came to the realization that we did not need as many entities as we thought, in fact, we could condense distributors and donors in one and make our ERD more efficient. The decision to further condense distributor and donor was also primarily influenced by Dr. Joneâ€™s feedback was later supported by Brian. We understand that Conceptual models are particularly useful to clearly see how different entities influenced others and give a visual means to represent the relationship between them. 

Furthermore, looking back at our P1 E-R- model allowed us to ponder whether or not we should have a Message entity. We discussed if it could be an attribute, but later realized that for efficiency purposes, we should have it as an entity. Once we established it was an entity, we developed the relationships and the attributes inside the Message entity itself. We strongly believe that having this addition makes our ERD diagram more efficient. Moreover, we changed names around so they are clearer than before, we did so because it was part of our feedback. 

In addition, we also edited our schema, and added all the new attributes and entities that we discussed during our meeting and the recommendations made by our professors. The schema is also clearly visible.  
In the future, we will keep checking our feedback and making our diagrams and schemas better according to the information gathered each time. 

# Domain Definition Table

This is an internally created ID to uniquely identify Food Banks

DO_ID - only for Donors
